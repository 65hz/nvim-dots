# My Neovim Dotfiles
It is really rudimentary but it is my first ever config I made myself, it was always distributions before then.

## How to setup
```
cp -r ~/{.config,.cache,.local/{share,state}}/nvim ~/(backup location of your choice) # backup your things first
git clone https://github.com/65hz/nvim-dots ~/.config/nvim # then clone it
```
